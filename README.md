# PokemonGoMalwareFilter

A program that identifies a malicious version of Pokemon Go for Android.

# Who Should Use This Program?
Android users who have downloaded a Pokemon Go APK 
from a third-party site (not Google Play).

# Setup
* Obtain the main program: git clone https://github.com/olivo/PokemonGoMalwareFilter

# Use
Run the following command: 

python pokemon_go_filter.py \<apk_file\> [--check\_hash] [--check\_permissions]

Where --check\_hash and --check\_permissions are optional flags that instruct 
the program to check whether the hashes are the same and the requested 
permissions of the provided APK are also requested by the official APK, 
respectively.

By default, the program checks for exact hash equality.

# Scope

The program checks the following:
* The SHA256 of the APK matches the official release (Default mode).
* The provided APK does not request extra permissions with respect to the official release.
